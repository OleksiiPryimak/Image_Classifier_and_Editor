<h1>Image_Classifier_and_editor</h1>
<p>This code trains and uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images as either "sky" or "galaxy".</p>

<h2>Data</h2>
<p>The data for this model is stored in the data directory. Each subdirectory within the data directory contains images of either "sky" or "galaxy".
More data = better predictions. 
All data for this model downloaded frome Google only for testing and training this model.</p>

<p>The trained model is saved to the models directory.</p>

<h2>Edit predicted images</h2>
<p>The add_text_sky and add_text_galaxy functions are used to add text to the two images that were predicted to be "sky" and "galaxy".The images are then saved to the edited_data directory.</p>

<p>For adding text i use Ballet Harmony.ttf from https://www.dafont.com/ballet-harmony.font</p>

<h2>Data to be predicted:</h2>
